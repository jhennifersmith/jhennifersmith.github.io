                I like working with computers. It's my hobby and my profession. I love the Internet and the way it works, and I am comfortable working on backend.

                My role models include old-school programmers and <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">hackers</a> who never make it to the mainstream news, but are responsible for most of the software that most people use on an everyday basis. I promote, support and use free and open source software to the extent possible.

                I maintain a little blog here, where I write about my recent interests and other activities. I post my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/jhennifersmith">GitHub</a>. My email address can be found at the <span class="extra-link"><a href="#extra">bottom</a></span> of this page.
